# English Classes

Presently private and group classes are only available to Colombia residents. Soon classes will be opened globablly through [iTalki.com](iTalki.com).

Until then I'll post notes about my methodology, as well as material for others to use.

## Class Structure

Classes begin with hello's and how are you's; then are quickly followed by practicing a series of tongue-twisters. Also, numbers, dates and monetary values are practiced. Numbers can be a very tricky concept to translate and understand in new languages; while the tongue-twisters enable us to exercise our mouths, vocal chords and minds for the task at hand!

After this we will begin to read, either articles or a book. The student will read, I'll make corrections as we proceed. Every few paragraphs we'll review what we've read and answer any questions about the words or phrases used.

We conclude class by having small discourse about the article and any other topic that might catch our fancy.

### Additional Modules

**TEDTalks & Essays**
This has become a go-to exercise for advanced learners; provide them a link to a TEDTalk, which they then watch. Afterwards they need to present their reflections of the talk.

Our target is to present information in a five-paragraph essay format ... Introduction, three supporting ideas, conclusion. We use this as a very basic outline for practicing what I've terms *continuity of thought*.

For intermediate learners this exercise can be drawn back, by providing the transcript as well. Herein the student is to highlight all of the pertinent information from the talk. By reading the parts they highlight, a listener who knows nothing of the talk ought to be get the basics of the talk.
